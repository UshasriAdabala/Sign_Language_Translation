# Sign Language Translation

Sign Language Translation is a machine learning-based project designed to translate sign language gestures into text, enabling more accessible communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The project utilizes computer vision and natural language processing techniques to recognize and interpret sign language from video or image input.

## Introduction

Sign language is a vital means of communication for millions worldwide, yet barriers remain for integration with spoken and written language systems. This project aims to address this challenge by providing a tool that translates sign language gestures into text, supporting accessibility and inclusion[3][4][5].

---

## Features

- Detects and translates sign language gestures from video or image input
- Converts recognized gestures into readable text
- Utilizes machine learning and computer vision models for gesture recognition
- Modular and extensible codebase for experimentation and improvement

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies:**
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Install required packages (listed in `requirements.txt` if available):
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- If no `requirements.txt` is present, install common libraries:
  ```
  pip install numpy pandas opencv-python scikit-learn tensorflow
  ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your input data (video or image of sign language gestures).
2. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to process the input and generate text output.
3. Review the translated text results.

Example (if using a notebook):

---

## Project Structure

- `data/` – Sample videos or images for testing
- `notebooks/` or `.ipynb` files – Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and experimentation
- `src/` or `.py` files – Source code for model training and inference
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

---

## How It Works

- The system uses computer vision models to extract features from sign language gestures in video or image input.
- Machine learning or deep learning models are trained to recognize and classify these gestures.
- Recognized gestures are mapped to corresponding text, providing a readable translation[3][4][5].
